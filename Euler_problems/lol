A sweet-lover faces N bowls in a row.

Bowl i holds Aᵢ fluffy rasgullas.

They may pick:

a starting bowl l and ending bowl r (0 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N - 1), and
a number x of rasgullas (x ≥ 1) such that every bowl from l to r contains at least x rasgullas.
They then scoop exactly x rasgullas from each bowl l … r.

What is the greatest total number of rasgullas they can eat?
